Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well.
My name is Geneviève Masioni, and I recently created a GitHub repository called Storyteller Tactics Lab. I'm reaching out because I discovered that you've forked this repository.

**I want to inform you that the content in the original repository contains copyrighted material. As a result, I’ve had to take down the original repository after Pip Decks reached out to me.**

**To avoid any potential copyright issues, I kindly request that you delete or privatize your forked version of the Storyteller Tactics Lab repository.**

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!



Sincerely, 

Geneviève Masioni
